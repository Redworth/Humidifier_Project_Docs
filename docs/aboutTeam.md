Rohit is actively and passionately working on this project

### Why did we start?
Rohit has always been curious on how technologies work and how they are made. He loves to read articles about technology and how they work. When he met up with his friends who have similar interests, they wanted to form a team, explore new technologies as well as try out existing technologies. They decided to put this idea into action, and they formed Redworth.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to introduce new and innovative technologies, and make them accesible to the world. We also want to try and improve existing technologies.

### Current project

The project is about turning a commonly used consumer product smarter, and the product we chose was the humidifier. We observed that there are some humidifiers in the market right now that have smartphone based control, but they do not have built in intelligence to adjust to the current environment automatically. Alongside that, we noticed that many smart home devices cannot be controlled if the mobile device is outside the network the device is connected to. We wanted to use the latest technology to find a solution to this problem by adding built in intelligence to the humidifier.
